# MNIST-CIFAR-100-Dataset-Exploration-using-PyTorch
This project demonstrates how to **download, preprocess, and visualize** two popular image datasets — **MNIST** and **CIFAR-100** — using the `torchvision` library.  
It covers dataset loading, splitting into training and testing sets, and displaying sample images with their corresponding labels.
